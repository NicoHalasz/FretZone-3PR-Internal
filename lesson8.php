<h2>Lesson 8: Introduction to Basic Songs</h2>

<p><strong>Now that you know chords, strumming patterns, and can read simple tabs, it’s time to play your first real song!</strong> This lesson will show you how to combine everything you’ve learned into a complete song, even as a beginner.</p>

<h3>1. Choosing a Simple Song</h3>

<p>Pick a song that uses the chords you already know (C, G, and D major). Many beginner-friendly songs only use 2–4 chords and simple strumming patterns. The key is to keep it simple and focus on smooth transitions.</p>

<h3>2. Chord and Lyric Layout</h3>

<p>Here’s how to read a song for beginners:</p>

<p>Chords are written above the lyrics at the point where you change them. For example:</p>

<pre>
G             C
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
G             D
How I wonder what you are.
</pre>

<p>Play the chord listed above the word, then strum according to your chosen pattern.</p>

<h3>3. Strumming the Song</h3>

<p>Use the strumming pattern you’ve practiced, for example:</p>

<p><strong>Down – Down – Up – Up – Down</strong></p>

<p>Count out loud if necessary: “1 – 2 – and – and – 4.” Focus on keeping a steady rhythm. Your left hand will change chords while your right hand continues strumming.</p>

<h3>4. Step-by-Step Practice</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Start by playing the first chord and strumming the pattern slowly.</li>
  <li>Change to the next chord when indicated above the lyrics.</li>
  <li>Keep the strumming hand moving even while changing chords — don’t stop.</li>
  <li>Repeat each line of the song until you can play it smoothly.</li>
</ol>

<h3>5. Looping Sections</h3>

<p>Most songs repeat sections like verses and choruses. Practice looping these sections several times. This helps you get used to repeating chord changes and improves muscle memory.</p>

<h3>6. Tips for Playing Songs</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Start slow — clarity is more important than speed.</li>
  <li>Focus on smooth chord transitions and consistent strumming.</li>
  <li>Sing along or hum the melody if you like — it helps with timing.</li>
  <li>Practice small sections at a time, then combine them into the full song.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Building Confidence</h3>

<p>Don’t worry if the song doesn’t sound perfect at first. Even experienced players practice slowly before playing at full speed. With regular practice, your fingers and strumming will become more coordinated.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>- Choose a simple song that uses chords you know.<br>
- Read chords above the lyrics to know when to change.<br>
- Use your practiced strumming pattern consistently.<br>
- Practice line by line, then loop sections for repetition.<br>
- Focus on smooth transitions and steady rhythm before speed.<br>
- With regular practice, you’ll soon be able to play entire songs confidently.</p>

<p>In the next lesson, we’ll review techniques to strengthen your fingers and improve your chord accuracy even further.</p>
